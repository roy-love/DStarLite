# DStarLite

D\*Lite, as explained in [this paper](https://github.com/SorcerersApprentice/DStarLite/blob/master/dlite_tro05.pdf).
Also, [relevant wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D*).

Language: **C#**

[In Java.](https://github.com/SorcerersApprentice/DStarLiteJava)

License: **MIT**, feel free to use in your projects.

####Current State:
**Second** (*optimized*) version, operational. Tweaking will probably be required to be used in a real environment. Nevertheless, the code works, and is sufficiently good for *educational purposes*.

####Thoughts:

At first, I intended to write up an explanation to this algorithm, but having written it made me reconsider as I feel it would be far too much work and the paper *sufficiently summarizes* its function (if one is patient enough to read it).

If you *don't* have enough background in advanced algorithms, I recommend taking your time and working your way through all the versions, **starting with LPA***.
