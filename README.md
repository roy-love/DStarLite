# DStarLite

D*Lite, as explained in [this paper](http://pub1.willowgarage.com/~konolige/cs225b/dlite_tro05.pdf).

Language: **C#**

License: **MIT**, feel free to use in your products.

Current state: **Second** (optimized) version, operational. **Warning:** I did not implement a priority queue, you will have to do that yourself. Also, tweaking will probably be required to be used in a real environment. Nevertheless, the code works, and is sufficiently good for *educational purposes*.

At first, I intended to write up an explanation to this algorithm, but having written it made me reconsider as I feel it would be far too much work and the paper *sufficiently summarizes* its function (if one is patient enough to read it).

If you *don't* have enough background in advanced algorithms, I recommend taking your time and working your way through all the versions, **starting with LPA***.
