# DStarLite

D*Lite, as explained in [this paper](https://github.com/SorcerersApprentice/DStarLite/blob/master/dlite_tro05.pdf).

Language: **C#**

[In Java.](https://github.com/SorcerersApprentice/DStarLiteJava)

License: **MIT**, feel free to use in your products.

####Current State:
**Second** (*optimized*) version, operational. Tweaking will probably be required to be used in a real environment. Nevertheless, the code works, and is sufficiently good for *educational purposes*.

####Thoughts:

At first, I intended to write up an explanation to this algorithm, but having written it made me reconsider as I feel it would be far too much work and the paper *sufficiently summarizes* its function (if one is patient enough to read it).

If you *don't* have enough background in advanced algorithms, I recommend taking your time and working your way through all the versions, **starting with LPA***.

I, also, intended to translate it to Python, but seeing as there already exist open source projects of it in Python, I chose to work on different projects in Python instead.
